# MPJM (Mi Primer Juego Mal)

A simple 2d game, a personal project for an university assignment.

Made with C++/SFML library.

## Introduction & explanation:

It's a vertical shooting game and consist of:

- 1 type of enemy
- 1 type of weapon
- 1 level
- 10 sublevels (each one containing more enemies of greater tier)

Killing enemies gives points, the amount of points gained increases with the enemy tier.

Once finished, each sublevel guarantees +1 life on the next sublevel. Also, when finished, the lifes counter on that sublevel gets multiplied and converted in bonus points (the +1 life reward it's not included in the sum).
